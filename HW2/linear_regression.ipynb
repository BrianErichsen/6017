    "Note: the Z value you compute is assumed to be distributed according to the standard normal distribution (mean = 0, variance = 1). We'll consider the \"1-sided\" p-value which meaures the probability of a sample having a Z value that is more extreme in only one tail (to get the 2-sided value, you'd just multiply by 2).\n",

For example, what do you expect to happen to your p value if b is clicked 560 or 570 times? This is JUST for understanding the results, and shouldn't bias your decision one way or another!"
